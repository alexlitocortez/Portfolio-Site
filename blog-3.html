    <title>My Schedule For Learning To Code</title>

    <p>
        In the beginning, I would code as long as my head could take. While that’s not the best strategy, I knew I had to do it because my learning curve was steep.<br>
<br>
I used Treehouse to learn the fundamentals. It gave me a roadmap for what to learn. While I didn’t finish the course, I learned enough to start small projects.<br>
<br>
After Treehouse, I would just code for 3-4 hours in the morning while trying to build projects out. I would code for less hours due to frustration. I would get stuck on problems for so long it made me want to stop for the day.<br>
<br>
This trend continues to this day. I still get frustrated, but I feel more productive coding for 3-4 hours a day. Sometimes I’ll code for 3 hours straight, and do 1 hour later in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
Other times I’ll split coding sessions into 2 sets. For those who want to learn code, I recommend whatever works best for you.<br>
<br>
Some people can code all day while others are best for a couple hours. I’m sure my schedule will change again, it’s just a matter of time.<br>
