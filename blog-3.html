    <h1>My Schedule For Learning To Code</h1>
    
<p>In the beginning, I would code as long as my head could take. While that’s not the best strategy, I knew I had to do it because my learning curve was steep.</p><br>

<p>I used Treehouse to learn the fundamentals. It gave me a clear roadmap. While I didn’t finish the course, I learned enough to start small projects.</p><br>

<p>After Treehouse, I would just code for 3-4 hours in the morning while simultaneously building projects.</p><br>

<p>I would code for less hours due to frustration. Sometimes I would get stuck on problems for so long it made me want to stop for the day.</p><br>

<p>This trend continues to this day. I still get frustrated, but I feel more productive coding for 3-4 hours a day. Sometimes I’ll code for 3 hours straight, and do 1 hour later in the afternoon.</p><br>

<p>Other times I’ll split coding sessions into 2 sets. For those who want to learn code, I recommend whatever works best for you.</p><br>

<p>Some people can code all day while others are best for a couple hours. I’m sure my schedule will change again, it’s just a matter of time.</p><br>
