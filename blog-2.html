        Combining skills makes you more unique.
Let me use a sports reference for example. Lebron James, who is a physical force at 6’8 and 250 pounds can not only forcefully run with the ball, he can dribble.
This allows him to be a unique talent. This is what I’m trying to be in my career. I know it’s hard to be great at one thing, but it’s possible to be good at multiple skill sets.
My focus is to be great at coding while being good at marketing. I prefer to be the one building because it gives me more satisfaction by making something people find useful.
But knowing coding and marketing allows me to know how to build and sell. Being able to do both makes me a valuable part of a team.
It also gives me an insight to different type of marketing software. Knowing marketing and coding allows me to:

        <ul>
            <li>Communicate with developers and sales/marketing</li>
            <li>Create software</li>
            <li>Work with analytics in-depth</li>
        </ul>

Knowing both skills lets me communicated with both the sales and engineering team. I’ll understand the lingo of engineers and be able to decipher that and communicated it with sales.
Doing this makes me a liaison of some sorts. I can interpret and send messages between teams.<br>
<br>
The second reason I wanted to learn coding and use it with my marketing skills is to create software.
The power of software is all around us. All we need to do to realize this is by using our phones. Good software can help you with specific problems you may have.<br>
<br>
For example, I practice search engine optimization daily and I use software to help me find topics to write about.<br>
<br>
For my niche websites, I can create software to help me identify which websites to purchase for investment. Or, I can create chatbots to help customers troubleshoot. I can also build a theme plugin to customize my sites.
Coding and marketing also overlaps with data too. Click-through rate, traffic, conversions are all tracked by software.<br>
<br>
Now, you don’t need software to understand these terms. What coding will help me do is work with data platforms like Google Analytics better. I could also use a language like Python and analyze the data.<br>
<br>
In today’s world, knowing marketing and coding means you can also start an online business in your bedroom.
Both also require creativity too. But, the 3 reasons I stated are where I see the biggest reasons as to why you should learn both marketing and coding.
